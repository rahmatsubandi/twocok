            2COK was founded on Today, precisely on July 10, 2020. 2COK is also
            a parody of 1CAK. But in that respect I apologize to 1CAK.

            2COK is made with all my heart, for the entertainment of meme
            lovers. Of course this website still has a lot of shortcomings, so I
            as the owner of 2COK will always update this Website with all my
            heart, soul, and abilities. So that this website is much in demand
            by the Meme Indonesia Lovers. In the future we will update memes
            with images. And continue to expand until 'Fly to moon'.
